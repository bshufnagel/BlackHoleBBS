          1.  15 possible security levels for a user, allowing partial or
complete access to the BBS, including subsysop capabilities
          2.  User typing capabilities, which enable you to configure parts
of the BBS to be seen only by those with a particular user type.  Each user
may have up to 8 user types.

     - Controlled crash procedure to avoid users from being able to access
the BBS under unpredictable conditions.
