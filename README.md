# BlackHoleBBS
This is the Black Hole BBS (bulletin board system) program from 1987
for the IBM PC and compatible computer systems.  This program was
developed by me to provide similar functionality to another popular
BBS program at the time, MTABBS (Mike's Totally Awesome Bulletin Board
System), which ran on Radio Shack Model III and IV devices.  This
was also was a way for me to learn the Borland Turbo Basic development
environment which was mildly popular at the time.  Most of the
original Black Hole BBS code should be here, although there were a
couple small bits coded in Microsoft Assembler that seem to have gone
missing over the years. But even so hopefully folks find this code
useful for something.  :-)  Have fun!

Information from the original AD.MSG file (formatted for GitHub):

The Black Hole BBS is the newest bulletin board software package
for the IBM PC and compatibles, and will run on an IBM PC, XT, AT, or
compatible with at least 256K of memory, two floppy disk drives, and a
Hayes-compatible modem.  Written in Borland's Turbo Basic, these are some
of the features of the Black Hole BBS:

- Fast operation on either a floppy or hard disk

- Easily adjustable BBS parameters to allow you to quickly tailor the
BBS to fit your system

- Up to 48 user-creatable subboards

- Up to 48 user-creatable file areas

- One-key all new message scan

- Subboard filtering, so the All New Message scan will skip subboards
you don't wish to read

- Complete control over user access, including:
  1.  15 possible security levels for a user, allowing partial or
complete access to the BBS, including subsysop capabilities
  2.  User typing capabilities, which enable you to configure parts
of the BBS to be seen only by those with a particular user type.  Each user
may have up to 8 user types.

- Controlled crash procedure to avoid users from being able to access
the BBS under unpredictable conditions.
